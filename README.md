# 5-Year-ACS-Function
Function I am trying to build for KYA.  Goal is to create a function that uses the "acs" package in R.

How to use, change the varables at the top of the code for the years and ACS table numbers you would like to pull.  The function will default to Jefferson County Louisville, KY for the geography to use.
